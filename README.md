Building my own decryption algorithm based on an encryption algorithm I was given.

# About
I was given the encryption algorithm and told to figure out how it works. Once I was sure of that, I wrote a decryption code to parse out the original plaintext message. It is a simple problem, but one that had me really focusing on understanding exactly what the encryption algorithm is doing, and reversing that process to write the decryption function.
